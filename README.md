# Wox
Wox was created as part of a project for Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) and was presented at Nationals in the summer of 2023. Wox was created for the Computer Game and Simulation category which had a theme of "Word Game".

# Download
Wox can be downloaded from its itch.io page [here](https://thoup99.itch.io/wox).

# Inspiration
Tetris and Srabble werre the main inspirations for our game. We decided to mix the two and ended up with a game where players will drag blocks of letters and place them on a grid to clear words. Clearing words awards points and more space for players to work with.

# Achievements
Wox earned 4th place at the FBLA State Leadership Conference in Pennsylvania.

# Reflection
This game was the first one I've made that has ever been released. I did a majority of the programming work and have learned a lot from it. I've been working a lot more on code reusability and project organization as a result of this project.
A lot of the code in this game is reusable but editing some systems can be challenging or tedious. In my future projects like [Monopoly](https://github.com/thoup99/Monopoly) and my next unannounced game I have been writing better, more sustainable code.
I learned a lot from this experience and grew closer to my friends in the process, although it might not have placed at nationals we are all still proud of what we made and gained lots of valuable knowledge in the process.
